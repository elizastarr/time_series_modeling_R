# a.
For a number of time series realizations fingerprints in the time domain are given by means of their
autocorrelation functions. However, the order of presentations of time series and autocorrelation
functions is randomized. Identify the connection between the time series TS1, TS2, TS3 and the
autocorrelation functions AC1, AC2, AC3. Explicitly motivate your choice!

TS1:AC2 because it's the smoothest series, showing mostly just trend

```{r}
data = ts(get(load('../datasets/ARMAsimulations.RData')))
```
